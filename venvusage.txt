Hey Nerds,

Using virtual enviroments is easy!

1. cd into dim3
2. source venv/bin/activate
3. You can now pip install <package> and such without requiring sudo
4. You are now using python locally and can do cool things.
4.5. If this is the first time running the venv on your machine remember to run $pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Make sure you use "deactivate" before you leave the directory

Done!


Notes:
* If you pip install a new dependency you have to $pip freeze -r requirements.txt and alert the rest of the team to update their local venv.
